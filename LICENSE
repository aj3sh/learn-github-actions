   the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

   1. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part;
   2. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

b. Exceptions and Limitations.
   For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply

   to comply with its terms and conditions.

c. Term.
   The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).

d. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed.
   The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all

e. Downstream recipients.
   Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an
   offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the
   terms and conditions of this Public License.

   You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or 
   conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, 
   the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the 
   Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material. 

f. No endorsement.
   Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as 
   permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the 
   Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or

   receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a). 

=======================================================================

Section 3 – License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions:

a. Attribution.
   You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and
   indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable manner,
   but not in any way that suggests the Licensor endorses You or Your
   use.

=======================================================================

Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply
to Your use of the Licensed Material:

a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a) grants You the right to
   extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of
   the contents of the database;

b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents
   in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the
   database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its
   individual contents) is Adapted Material; and

c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all
   or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.

=======================================================================

   statutory, or other.

b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to
   You on any legal theory (including negligence) or otherwise for any
   losses arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed
   Material.

c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
   above shall be interpreted in a manner that most closely approximates
   an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.

=======================================================================

Section 6 – Term and Termination.

a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar
   Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public
   License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate
   automatically.

      is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
   2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

c. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
   right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations.

d. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may offer the Licensed
   Material under separate terms or stop distributing it at any time;
   however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.

e. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.

=======================================================================

Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.

a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms
