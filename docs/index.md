# GitHub Actions

## Introduction

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform that helps you automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline. It can be triggered by various events such as branch pushes, pull request creation, issue creation, or custom schedules. For instance, you can run linting, building, and testing on every pull request.

## Benefits of GitHub Actions

1. **Automation**

    GitHub Actions is not just a CI/CD tool; it is a complete automation platform directly integrated with your GitHub repository. It can streamline many repository tasks, making development faster and more efficient. Here are a few examples:

    - Approving, commenting, or declining PRs based on linting and checks.
    - Automatically adding appropriate labels to issues and PRs.
    - Publishing a patch release automatically when a hotfix branch is merged.

1. **Easy Integration**

    GitHub Actions is native to GitHub repositories, so no extra setup is required. Simply create a workflow YAML file inside the `.github/workflows` folder, and you’re good to go.

1. **Cost Efficient**

    GitHub Actions is completely free for public repositories, while private repositories receive a monthly quota of free minutes. [Learn more](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/concepts/product-billing/github-actions).

1. **Reusable Actions**

    With GitHub Actions, you can create reusable workflows that can be used across multiple repositories. You can also explore the GitHub Actions Marketplace, which offers pre-built actions created by GitHub and the open-source community.

1. **Security**

    GitHub Actions provides built-in features like secrets management and fine-grained permissions to ensure secure workflows.

1. **Cross-platform support**

    GitHub Actions offers hosted runners for Linux, Windows, and macOS, with the option to use self-hosted runners for more control and customization.

## Github Actions Marketplace

[GitHub Actions Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions) is the central hub for discovering thousands of pre-built actions that can be used in your workflows. Major actions are [maintained by GitHub](https://github.com/actions/), ensuring reliability and regular updates, while many others are contributed by the open-source community.

Using the Marketplace, you can search for actions that suit your specific workflow needs—whether it’s CI/CD pipelines, code analysis, testing, deployment, or notifications. Integrating these actions allows you to automate repetitive tasks efficiently, without having to write every step from scratch.
